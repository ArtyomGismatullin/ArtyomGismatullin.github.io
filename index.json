Programming language defines the set of lexical, syntactic and semantic rules that define the appearance of the program and the actions that the executor (usually a computer) will perform under its control.\nНаучное програмирование\nНаучное программирование — высокоориентированный стиль программирования для научных расчетов. От других видов программирования его отличают предельные корректность и стабильность конечного продукта, строгое разделение научной и интерфейсной частей, индивидуальность алгоритмов, а также преобладание эффективности над универсальностью.\nНаучное программирование лежит в основе любого современного глобального исследования. Все передовые технологии — от квантовых компьютеров до космических программ — были бы невозможны без специалистов в области научного программирования, способных предоставить ученым надежный и точный инструмент для совершения открытий.\nРяд отраслей науки непосредственно зависят от уровня развития научного программирования. Так, своего исполнения ждут беспилотный транспорт, «умные» системы управления городским и сельским хозяйством, фондовыми биржами; ждут робототехника, генная инженерия, искусственный интеллект, превосходящий возможности человека.\nСпециализации\nУченые используют различные языки программирования, выбор которых зависит от типа задачи и предпочтений автора. Исторически первым высокоуровневым языком программирования является Fortran, на нем написано много отлаженных библиотек математической статистики и библиотек для решения дифференциальных уравнений, что актуально для экономики и биологии соответственно. Более простым синтаксисом обладает Python, также подходящий для программирования математических вычислений.\nЯзык Python привлекается для обработки данных в математике, физике, экономике, биологии, химии и умеет работать с некоторыми другими «научными» языками: Fortran, C++, C#. В свою очередь C# позволяет программировать на платформе .NET, адаптировать программу к общеязыковой исполняющей среде (CLR) и ускорить разработку в рамках оперативных научных сессий.\n","date":1683873072,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683873072,"objectID":"0d513b9f67397874cba3e1134a1ed503","permalink":"https://example.com/post/%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/","publishdate":"2023-05-12T09:31:12+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%83%D1%87%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F/","section":"post","summary":"Programming languages\nProgramming language - a formal language designed for recording computer programs.

Git is currently one of the most popular version control systems used in various fields such as programming, science, design, and many others.\nThe main advantages of using Git for development are:\nVersion control: Git allows you to keep track of all changes that have been made to a project, allowing you to quickly roll back the project to a previous version if necessary.\nTeamwork: Git makes it easy to share and collaborate on projects. In development teams, Git allows you to simply merge changes, which improves connectivity and reduces development time.\nBackup: Git provides quick and efficient backups of projects and individual files, which keeps your data safe in the event of server or computer failure.\nOffline work: Git allows developers to work offline, which improves connectivity, reduces development time, and increases efficiency.\nIntegration: Git integrates with various services such as GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitea, GitLab, and others, allowing for easy project collaboration and release readiness.\nUsing Git is an essential tool for managing and controlling project versions to help reduce development time and improve project quality.\n","date":1679065079,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679065079,"objectID":"b51c39c0ac0ec5a38bb139cda30bb055","permalink":"https://example.com/post/git/","publishdate":"2023-03-17T17:57:59+03:00","relpermalink":"/post/git/","section":"post","summary":"Git is a version control system Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the Linux kernel source code.
